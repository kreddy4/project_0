testvector5=111101
#Adding two known bits of the two inputs gives the known output.

testvector1=1001uu
#adding an input with another input of unknown's gives the unknown at the respective unknowns

testvector2=111111
adding the two max inputs of the three bit series gives the four bit series output with carry 1

testvector3=uu10u1
#Adding an unkown bit with another unknown bit gives the unknown output.

testvector4=111000
#Adding any number with all zeros gives the same number.
