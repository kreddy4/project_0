#Six input vectors are clearly meant to be two 3 bit inputs.

testvector1=111101
#Two known inputs are given as input for the adder.
 So, Adding two known inputs gives the known output.

testvector2=1001uu
# One known input and another unknown input. 
  So, adding a known input unknown input gives the unknown output.
  
testvector3=111111
# Adding two max inputs of a series.
 So, adding the two max inputs(111 for three bit) of the three bit series gives the four bit series penultimate value as output.
 In generalised way, adding two max inputs of a n bit series gives the n+1 bit series penultimate value.

testvector4=uu11u0
# Two unknowns are given as input for the adder.
 So, Adding an unkown bit with another unknown bit gives the unknown output.

testvector5=111000
# One input vector is zero vector and another is any known vector.
 So, Adding any known input with the zero vector input gives the same input.
